# Hello-World
AvE username was taken so I had to use my last name. This is my GitHub thing. Yay!
I'm thankful for your suggestions and am glad I got a nudge into the Git thing.
This will work out great, and anybody who wants to help or have a peek or use the code will be able to get it here.
Yay internets!
